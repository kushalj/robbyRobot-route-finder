# robbyRobot-route-finder
code for a coding puzzle

robbyRobot.js
=============

A first attempt and slight clunky cell coord system. Route finding uses a Djikstra type algorithm
Worked on tests but failed on large coord sets and datasets


robbyRobot2.js
=============

A second attempt that uses a better coordinate system and has optimisations in place:

1. function calls removed from loops and inlined
1. most variable assingments removed from loops and cached using ```JS let``` variables


robbyRobot3.js
=============

A first attempt and slight clunky cell coord system. Route finding uses a Djikstra type algorithm

robbyRobot4.js (work in progress!)
==================================
